community_desc: "<p>Following the European project in which was developed the infrastructure, users, developers, service providers
  and new partners have formed an association to give it a neutral and open governance.</p>
  <p>Created on February 5, 2016, the association is designed to value the Ozwillo infrastructure, to promote the communicating
    applications which join it and to create favorable conditions for innovation.</p>
  <p>It aims knowledge sharing by enabling links between all types of data models and data for the benefit of its members
    and non-members.</p>
  <p>It guarantees a neutral and fair operation of the Ozwillo infrastructure, and encourages the development of relationships
    between all users and contributors.</p>
  <p>Real trusted third party, it seeks to preserve digital commons, according to the following principles specific to
    initiate a virtuous circle:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A neutral and fair factory of digital commons, fostering creativity and innovation (system);</li>
    <li>A governance guarantor of the digital commons and promoting the self-organisation of the system;</li>
    <li>Inspires confidence due to its governance representing all of civil society;</li>
    <li>Remains of collective interest and triggers a virtuous circle;</li>
    <li>Acknowledges all types of contributions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Ozwillo is a foreshadowing association, which aims to create the conditions for setting up a sustainable legal
    structure to value its assets.</p>"

governance_title: Join the governance
governance_desc_part1: "<p>Only individuals, in their name or as a representative of a legal entity, who share the values
  of the association and who bring proven skills to support the operations of the association may be admitted as members
  of the association.</p>
  <p>The association represents all of civil society and leads a socially-minded project based on the creation of common
    digital good that can be reused with the objective of accessibility and preservation of digital wealth.</p>"
governance_desc_quote: "« Digital goods are no longer excludable. The use thereof by one person in no way affects the use
  thereof by some else as the reproduction of a digital good (music file, network document, web page, etc.) has a near-zero
  marginal cost. One could infer that these Commons are 'inexhaustible' and that digital abundance has arrived. If one
  considers Commons to be a space for governance, one notices, on the contrary, that these new knowledge Commons are fragile. »"

governance_desc_part2: "<p>The principles of operation of the association are based on values characteristic of a Knowledge Society :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Humans are at the heart of the system;</li>
    <li>Open availability is a fundamental key to create and innovate;</li>
    <li>The management and governance forms are transversal;</li>
    <li>Economic models are shifting towards “win-win”, circular models.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The OZWILLO association therefore does not favour any type of political proselytising and cannot be chaired by an
  elected official currently in office</p>"
