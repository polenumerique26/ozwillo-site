  <strong>The realization of a demonstrator is justified:</strong>"
demonstrator_column_1_item_1: Validate to scale, design solutions adopted in R & D on "the bench" or test equipment or demonstrators at the reduced scale
demonstrator_column_1_item_2: Assessing performance in a close environment of a real situation and at the right scale
demonstrator_column_1_item_3: Demonstrate the relevance of innovation and its competitive advantages in a perspective of innovation by usage, more and more often.
