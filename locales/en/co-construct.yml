main_title: Co-construct the common good ...

main_subtitle_1: Ozwillo is intended to be a neutral guarantor allowing all applications providers, owners or Open Source,
  to market their services and will allow any user to manage his own data.
main_subtitle_2: Any Ozwillo user will also be free to change his software solution without any exit cost due to the
  retrieval of his data from one application to the other. Data which are neither personal nor sensitive can be reusable
  via API. To promote this reuse of data, each application provider will have to modelize his data thanks to the tools
  available on Ozwillo. This “store” of applications and data is an alternative to giants of information. It is a support
  of a virtuous ecosystem where data is a common good, creating values.
